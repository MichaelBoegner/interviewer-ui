            <strong>‚úÖ What is it?</strong>
            <br />
            Interviewer is a solo-built, AI-powered platform that simulates
            backend engineering interviews. Each interview features real-time
            questions, tailored feedback, and a final score. You also get access
            to past interviews you've already started or completed so you can
            review and improve.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a solo dev, I made Interviewer because I always feel so nervous
            about an upcoming interview, no matter how confident I feel in my
            knowledge. Part of that is just wanting to do well, but I think a
            bigger part comes from so infrequently getting to test my knowledge
            in an interview setting. So I created something to help myself, and
            hopefully others, get more comfortable through regular practice, so
            the nerves don‚Äôt get in the way.
