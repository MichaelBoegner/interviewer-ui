## ðŸ¤” Discovery of the Day
While I understood the concept of go routines, placing one into practice today forced me to better understand the nuances of how it works. 


### âœ… Learnings
1. Server functionality and tying up ports
When a request hits the server, Go spins up a goroutine for that request's handler. Until the handler finishes, the server keeps resources open, including the TCP connection, socket buffers, and memory.

If a handler spends time waiting on an external service (like sending an email), it holds onto those resources longer than necessary. Over time, too many "stuck" handlers can overload the server, not because goroutines are heavy, but because the system can't close connections and free up ports fast enough.

By spawning a background goroutine for slow/externally async tasks and responding immediately, the server can release those connections and stay fast and scalable.

2. Keeping `go func()` isolated from handler variables
Inside a handler, local variables (like `err`, `params`, etc.) only exist during the life of that specific request. If a goroutine captures those local variables without making safe copies, it can behave unpredictably:
a. It might read wrong or changed data.
b. It might cause race conditions.
c. It might try to work with request-specific values that no longer exist.

*Solution:*
When starting a go func(), always pass any needed variables into the closure directly. This ensures the goroutine has a clean, independent copy and is not relying on fragile, temporary handler state.

3. In the case of my `Billing` call to `b.CreateCheckoutSession` though, I did not implement a go routine as the handler process/frontend, is dependent upon the returned checkout url from Lemon Squeezy(LS). As a result, I implemented a `&Client{}.Timeout=10*time.Second` in the call to LS itself to avoid any hanging. 

4. While I believe LS offers idempotent ids, I am going to avoid retries on failures there for now to keep things simple and 100% avoid duplicate checkout creations.
