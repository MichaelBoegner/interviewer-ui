# Learning Log - Why?

A while back, I noticed that almost every morning, when I first look at my codebase, I have a question that I seek an answer to. 

As a result, I started a journal where I enter those questions/answers to document my growth as an engineer. I have a backlog in google docs that I'll slowly be transfering over as well.
