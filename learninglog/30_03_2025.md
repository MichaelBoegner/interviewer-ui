## 🤔 Discovery of the Day
What do you do when you have a func that you need run globally and want to catch the err?

### ✅ Learnings
1. This is where the init() func comes into play. I had seen this func long ago when I first started studying Go and had trouble imagining/understanding the use case. However, this appears to be a good case. 

I am writing my response mock for my CreateConversation integration test and wanted to write a func for marshalling the ChatGPTResponse structs that come back with every other message. However, everything is global in that file, since it's just variable instantiations. Go runs init() automatically before tests or main execution, and inside it you can check and react to errors. 

See docs: https://go.dev/ref/spec#Package_initialization

### 🔁 TODO
- Confirm whether you should write a file specifically for init()
