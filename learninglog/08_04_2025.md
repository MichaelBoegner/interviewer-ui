# Learning Log

## ðŸ¤” Discovery of the Day

While writing the `AppendConversation_isFinished` integration test, I ran into a subtle issue with how test case factories were being evaluated. I was using method calls like `conversationBuilder.NewIsFinishedConversationMock()` inside the test case struct, but Go evaluates those expressions immediately when the test table is declared, not lazily at test execution time. As a result, the builder was being prematurely mutated all the way to its `isFinished` state, causing incorrect test expectations. 

### âœ… Learnings

1. Solution was to write a closure returning an anonymous func that would defer execution of the given conversation build until test time. This required an additional TestCase field and some basic conditional logic to pull the tc.respBodyFunc vs the tc.respBody as needed.  

2. Closures in Go capture variables by reference, which was a great thing to learn in my case, as a pure value capture would have forced me to find another solution and maybe abandon my method approach altogether. 

3. This all also meant that I had to be sure that the returned func only got called once during the test cases, so still not perfect if I needed to call it multiple times for some reason. 

4. And while I had already learned the below some time before, I felt like writing it out again as a way of cementing my understanding/learnings, since this was the first time in production that I was forced to build out a closure like this: 

For the func below: 
a. It's a higher order func, that means it's a func that takes another func, which is okay in go because go treats funcs as first class variables. 
b. The closure portion is the inner anon func itself, which maintains a reference to the pointer to the return value, NOT just the value itself. 
c. Because a reference to the pointer is stored and NOT just the value, you can call that build as many times as you want until there is no longer a reference to the func itself, at which point garbage collection occurs. 

```
func (b *ConversationBuilder) NewCreatedConversationMock() func() handlers.ReturnVals {
	return func() handlers.ReturnVals {
		b.WithTopic("Introduction", 1).
			WithQuestion(1, 1, "Question1").
			WithMessage(1, 1, mocks.MessagesCreatedConversationT1Q1).
			WithQuestion(1, 2, "Question2").
			WithMessage(1, 2, mocks.MessagesCreatedConversationT1Q2).
			WithTopic("Coding", 2).
			WithTopic("System Design", 3).
			WithTopic("Databases and Data Management", 4).
			WithTopic("Behavioral", 5).
			WithTopic("General Backend Knowledge", 6)
		return handlers.ReturnVals{Conversation: b.Convo}
	}
}
