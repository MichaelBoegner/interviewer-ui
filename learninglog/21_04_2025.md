## ðŸ§ª Learning Highlights (April 11â€“21)

### Comprehensive Test Suite Implementation
Over the past 10 days, I fully implemented a robust test suite from scratch, including both integration and unit tests. This forced me to think deeply about architecture and test coverage in a way I hadn't before.

### Misconceptions About Unit Testing
I realized my earlier approach to testing was misaligned. I was unit testing handlersâ€”despite most logic being delegated to services. Refactoring this approach improved test clarity and surfaced better testing targets.

### Integration Testing as a Diagnostic Tool
Shifting to integration tests revealed critical edge cases and system weaknesses that were missed in my initial go-to-market build. It drove necessary improvements across the codebase and database logic.

### AWS Deployment (ECS + Fargate)
I successfully deployed the project to AWS using ECS and Fargate. This hands-on work significantly improved my understanding of AWS infrastructure and container orchestration at scale.

### Strategic Re-Evaluation of Deployment Approach
While deploying to AWS was valuable for showcasing technical capability, it's overkill for early-stage usage. I now view it as a future-proofing step rather than a default.

### Focus Shift: From Foundations to Users
With core functionality and professional infrastructure in place, Iâ€™m transitioning focus toward growing a user base rather than continuing backend enhancements.

### Keeping AWS in Reserve
Iâ€™m maintaining the AWS wiring for when traffic or reliability needs make it worthwhile, but will continue using Fly.io for low-cost, fast iteration in the meantime.

### Next Steps: Go-To-Market Essentials
To support this new focus, I'm now shifting toward key GTM tasks:

- Password recovery system 
- Payment integration  
- Dashboard of interviews and results
- Email confirmation on signup
- Rate limiting for subscription levels
- Profile page to change subscription
- Basic user security protocols  
- A functional landing page
- Restructure user models to reflect subscription tier
- User analytics
- Marketing
