## ü§î Discovery of the Day
How do you test for timestamps, like created_at/updated_at, when there is bound to be a differential of milliseconds between test suite and prod, due to compiling order. 

Also, another great example of the importance of testing. Testing brought to light time discrepancy issue. All `time.Now()` `now` vars were in local time and being submitted to the DB as such, which then stores that time as UTC. Converted all `now` vars to UTC as a result.

### ‚úÖ Learnings
1. `cmpopts` package offers the `func cmpopts.EquateApproxTime(margin time.Duration) cmp.Option` which allows for a margin of acceptable differential time to be passed. 


See docs: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp/cmpopts 

### üîÅ TODO
- Apply to ConversationHandlers integration test. 
- Add UTC() to all `now` vars
