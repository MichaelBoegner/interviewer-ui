## ü§î Discovery of the Day
In starting to write my integration test cases for `AppendConversationsHandler()`, my mock responses risk bloating the code and violating the DRY prinicple. As a result, 
I need a factory to produce the encapsulate the otherwise complex structure of the `ConversationMocks` and make it easily generated for the first and any additional `AppendConversationsHandler()` tests. 
- Reduces clutter
- Makes the intent of the test clearer
- Makes onboarding easier (even for future you)

Also, I now have a better understanding the Go conventional pattern of NewX() for struct instantiation/default param settings, which is very similar to OOP's `__init__` method, in that it sets field values on creation of the struct, much like you would an object in a class. 

### ‚úÖ Learnings
1. Factory vs. Helper
A helper is a generic utility function that makes your test code cleaner or DRY-er. It doesn‚Äôt necessarily create whole objects, and it‚Äôs usually procedural.
A factory is a specific kind of helper that is responsible for building full test objects or data structures ‚Äî often with sensible defaults and optional overrides. Simulates domain state. 

2. Is this worth my time, even if I'm only going to test the `AppendConversationsHandler()` once? 
Yes! Signals higher-level thinking, antipating future complexity, test mantainability, and caring about structure vs. just making it work. 
Reduces clutter and makes intent clearer and reduces risks of mistakes as a result of bloated code. 
It is intentional design and expressive 

3. Also, factories/builders allow modification of the same instantiation as needed, as in the case of `AppendConversationsHandler()`, which avoids unecessary memory/time complexity and cleaner code. 

### üîÅ TODO
- Build the factory for mock conversation responses.
