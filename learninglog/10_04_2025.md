## 🤔 Discovery of the Day

1. To write the `CreateUser_Success` for `Test_CreateUsersHandler_Integration`, I needed to return a UserID, which meant rewriting my `repo.CreateUser` to return an ID and then modify my return values to include that id, so that I could then use it to call the DB to make sure the user existed in the Users table as expected. HOWEVER, the reason I wasn't originally returning the userID to begin with was becuase the frontend didn't really need it because JWT was returned with userID  stored in it after the user logged in. 

I woke up this morning worried that maybe this was a bad pattern or practice. My ultimate reasoning for it being okay was that: 
a. The userID should be a default, useful piece of data to hand back to the frontend, even if it comes later from the JWT, since it, at the very least, prevents having to parse the JWT for it. 
b. Not doing it this way would require some sort of flaky mocking or alternative manual method not reliable in the long run. 
 
It turns out that my thinking was correct, per the below. 

2. Writing the test also exposed my lack of uniqueness enforcement on `username`, something I rushed past during early development. 
3. Finally, I also was exposed to proper test mapping to encapsulate and translate the uniqueness constraint code/messages coming back from PG. 

### ✅ Learnings
#### 🧪 Testing and Return Values in APIs
1. Go Blog – Testing Techniques
https://go.dev/blog/subtests

"Tests often need to verify internal state or outputs from functions that are not necessarily exposed to the end user."

2. Martin Fowler – Integration Testing
https://martinfowler.com/bliki/IntegrationTest.html

"A key characteristic of a good integration test is that it validates the collaboration between components and verifies the final system behavior, often by reading the state from a database."

3. Thoughtbot – Effective Testing with Mocks and Stubs
https://thoughtbot.com/blog/effective-testing-with-mocks-and-stubs

"Tests should rely on explicit data returned from the system under test... tests should not assume a system state that cannot be directly confirmed."

#### 🔐 APIs and Redundant Data for Flexibility
1. JSON API Specification – Top-Level Member id
https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-objects

"Resource objects must contain id and type members..."

2. REST API Design Rulebook by Mark Masse
ISBN: 978-1449310509 on Amazon

“Even if the client does not immediately need the resource ID, returning it helps support HATEOAS and self-discovery.”

#### 🧑‍💻 Practical Engineering Experience
1. Stripe API Docs – Create a Customer
https://stripe.com/docs/api/customers/create

"Every create request returns the full resource, including its ID... it makes subsequent requests more ergonomic."

2. GitHub REST API – Get a User
https://docs.github.com/en/rest/users/users?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-user

GitHub’s API always returns an id field for newly created or retrieved resources.


#### 🧑‍💻 Error Layering/Mapping 
1. PG error codes: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/errcodes-appendix.html

2. Go Docs on properly working with errors: https://go.dev/blog/go1.13-errors
