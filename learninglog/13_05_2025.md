## ü§î Discovery of the Day  
Credit-based enforcement is cleaner than time window rate limiting.

While planning how to enforce interview limits based on user subscription tiers, I initially leaned toward a date-based approach ‚Äî calculating each user‚Äôs subscription window and counting interviews during that period. But after mapping it out, I realized it introduced unnecessary complexity.

### ‚úÖ Learnings  
1. I started by drafting a `getCurrentCycleWindow(startDate)` function to determine a user‚Äôs current subscription window and then planned to count how many interviews were created within that range.

2. Although workable, this approach quickly became convoluted. It required logic for month boundaries, date math, and edge cases around renewal timing ‚Äî all just to answer the question: *"Can this user start another interview?"*

3. I realized a **credit-based model** would dramatically simplify things:
   - Add a fixed number of credits when a subscription is purchased or renewed  
   - Deduct a credit each time an interview is started  
   - Block the request if no credits remain  

4. This model cleanly separates billing from usage, mirrors established SaaS patterns (e.g. Stripe balance, OpenAI quotas), and scales well with future features like promo codes, one-off interview purchases, or admin-issued credits.

5. I‚Äôll still use the `getCurrentCycleWindow()` function, but only within a daily cron job that determines whether credits should be added for that user on their renewal date.

6. To ensure consistency, credit mutations will occur inside a SQL transaction and be logged to a `credit_transactions` table. This gives me real-time enforcement via `users.credits`, while also keeping an auditable log for reconciliation or dispute handling.

### üîÅ TODO  
- Add `credits` field to `users` table  
- Create `credit_transactions` table to log additions and deductions  
- Write `BillingService.AddCredits()` and `SubtractCredit()` with transaction wrapping  
- Update the interview start flow to enforce credit checks before proceeding  
- Handle Lemon Squeezy webhook events (`subscription_created`, `subscription_renewed`) by adding credits  
- Build a daily cron job to check for users due for credit renewal  
- Write unit and integration tests to verify credit logic and billing flow
