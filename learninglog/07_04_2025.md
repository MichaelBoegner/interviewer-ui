# Learning Log

## ðŸ¤” Discovery of the Day
I don't know how many times I can say that testing is great, but testing is in fact great. 

### âœ… Learnings
1. Not really a learning, but something worth acknowledging, which is that the front end can remain in a functional state, despite the fundamentals of the output from the backend still being incorrect. For example, my frontend is currently very basic due to this being a backend learning project, and, as a result, it is built to crawl the returned `conversation` JSON for the last message sent and hand that to the user. 

As a result, this means that it can still produce the correct message for the user and return the correct response to the backend, even though key data points are missing in the information, like the question prompt or numberings. There could also simply be duplicate messages in the `Messages` array in `Questions` that ultimately are ignored by the frontend but are critical in the data integrity of the database.
